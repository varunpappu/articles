# Inside Grafana Kubernetes Monitoring: Meet the Alloy Modules Powering Your Observability

Kubernetes environments are complex, and monitoring them effectively requires powerful, flexible, and scalable observability solutions. Grafana’s Kubernetes Monitoring Helm Chart provides just that—an integrated solution for monitoring metrics, logs, traces, profiling, and event visibility, all designed to scale with your Kubernetes workloads.

At the heart of this monitoring solution are the **Alloy modules**. These composable telemetry collectors handle different types of observability data with high performance and reliability. By separating responsibilities into specialized modules, Grafana enables you to easily scale, configure, and manage observability in your Kubernetes cluster.

## Why Should You Care About Alloy Modules?

Each **Alloy module** is optimized for handling a specific type of data—such as metrics, logs, or traces. By breaking observability down into these specialized modules, you can avoid unnecessary complexity and overhead, ensuring a streamlined, efficient monitoring solution tailored to your needs.

This series will take you behind the scenes of the **Alloy modules**, showing you how they work and the powerful features they enable. In the articles that follow, we’ll dive deep into each feature, explaining how to configure and use them in your environment.

## Understanding the Alloy Modules

The **Alloy modules** form the backbone of Grafana’s Kubernetes Monitoring Helm Chart. Each module specializes in a particular area of observability, helping you efficiently gather and process telemetry data from your Kubernetes clusters.

Here’s a breakdown of the key modules:

- **alloy-metrics**: Collects and forwards cluster-wide and application-specific metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, Prometheus metrics).
  
- **alloy-logs**: Gathers logs from your Kubernetes pods and nodes, providing visibility into what’s happening inside your cluster.

- **alloy-singleton**: Responsible for singleton tasks like collecting Kubernetes events, such as pod evictions and resource changes.

- **alloy-receiver**: Accepts data from your instrumented applications, including metrics, logs, and traces.

- **alloy-profiles (Optional)**: Captures application profiling data (e.g., CPU and memory usage) from pprof-compatible endpoints.

Each module is independently configurable, meaning you can tailor them to meet your specific needs while keeping your observability system modular and maintainable.

## Key Features Enabled by Alloy Modules

Now that we understand the **Alloy modules**, let’s look at the features they enable within your observability setup. These features unlock detailed insights into your Kubernetes environment and can be easily enabled or disabled based on your needs.

Here’s a breakdown of the features and the **Alloy modules** they rely on:

| **Collector**      | **Feature**                    | **Description**                                                               | **Telemetry Type** |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **alloy-metrics**  | **Cluster Metrics**            | Gather metrics from the entire cluster, such as node health, CPU, memory, etc. | Metrics           |
|                    | **Auto-Instrumentation**       | Automatically instrument workloads with OpenTelemetry SDKs.                    | All               |
|                    | **Annotation Autodiscovery**   | Discover and scrape metrics from services/pods using special annotations.     | Metrics           |
|                    | **Prometheus Operator Objects**| Support for ServiceMonitors, PodMonitors, and Probes.                         | Metrics           |
|                    | **Service Integrations**       | Built-in integrations for services like Redis, Postgres, etc.                 | Metrics           |
| **alloy-logs**     | **Node Logs**                  | Collect logs from Kubernetes nodes.                                           | Logs              |
|                    | **Pod Logs**                   | Collect logs from individual or selected pods.                                | Logs              |
| **alloy-singleton**| **Cluster Events**             | Collect Kubernetes event streams (e.g., pod evictions, deployments).         | Logs              |
| **alloy-receiver** | **Application Observability**  | Gather metrics, logs, and traces from your instrumented applications.         | All               |
| **alloy-profiles** | **Profiling**                  | Collect CPU/memory profiles from applications.                                | Profiles          |

These features work together to cover the full range of observability data you might need in your Kubernetes environment. The **Alloy modules** are modular, allowing you to enable only the features you need, reducing overhead and ensuring that you gather only the relevant telemetry.
